### What is the Fellowship?
The Fatima Al-Fihri Fellowship is a 9-month program in which computer science students from around the world who are planning on applying to PhD programs in the United States, work with current PhD students / researchers on research projects to strengthen their applications. The Fellowship is named after Fatima Al-Fihri who established in 859 CE the oldest-running university in the world, an international university for immigrants in Fez, Morocco.


### Why did we establish the Fellowship?
The Fellowship is motivated by two observations:
- There are many talented students from around the world who are interested in doing their PhD in the United States, and would make great doctoral students with significant impact on their fields and communities. However, many lack the research background and guidance in the application process needed to get into top PhD programs
- Increasingly, research in computer science and its subfields such as machine learning, can be done remotely using resources that are available to anyone who has access to the Internet. There are also lots of PhD students / researchers who are interested in remotely mentoring students from around the world and creating high-impact research projects together.

### Who’s eligible?
Any student around the world who is interested in applying to PhD programs in 2021 or 2022 in computer science or any of its subfields such as machine learning is eligible. We expect most applicants to be juniors, seniors, or Master’s students, but this is not necessarily a criterion for the fellowship.

### What are the benefits to Fellows?
1. Working closely with an experienced researcher. All of our mentors have published research papers in top conferences in computer science and have experience with a specific field of CS/ML.
2. Receiving coaching and mentorship for the PhD application process. 

### What are the expectations of Fellows?
Fellows should expect to be actively engaged in a research project with their research mentor from March to October (10 - 20 hrs / week of independent research + 1 hr / week meeting with their mentors). From October to December, Fellows will focus on preparing their PhD applications, but may continue to wrap up / publish their research projects.

### Who are the research mentors and what are the research projects?
When you join the Fellowship, you are paired with a research mentor and project based on your background. Research projects are determined based on mutual interest of the mentors and fellows. Current mentors and projects include:
- <a href="https://abidlabs.github.io/" target="_blank">Abubakar Abid</a> (Stanford): model interpretation, machine learning in medicine
- <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xfzbywYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Fatih Balin</a> (Georgia Tech): matrix algorithms, high performance computing
- <a href="https://moinnadeem.com/" target="_blank">Moin Nadeem</a> (MIT): natural language processing, bias in machine learning
- <a href="https://www.allaban.me/" target="_blank">Anas Abou Allaban</a> (CMU): speech recognition, robotics, reinforcement learning
