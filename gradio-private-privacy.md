# Privacy Policy for Gradio Private

This privacy policy describes how Gradio (“us” or “we”) protects your (“you”, “the user”) privacy and your data. Before using the Gradio Private application (“our library”), please read this policy.

If you use our library you fully agree to this privacy policy.

## General
Gradio Private makes it easy for teams and labs to deploy machine learning models as secure web applications with graphical user interfaces. Gradio Private is deployed on-premise, so the Gradio team never has any access to any data or model sent through the machine learning model.		

## Information Collection and Use
We never collect or share personal data with our library. We do collect general, anonymized statistics on the usage of our product, to let us know how many people are using the different features of the library. However, these data are aggregated and anonymized and never associated with a specific customer. Furthermore, they can be disabled entirely by the user.

# Children's Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. 

## Changes
Our library or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy might change.
