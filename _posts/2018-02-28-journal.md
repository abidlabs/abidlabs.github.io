On the advice of my professor, [as well as David Knuth](https://theorydish.blog/2018/02/26/donald-knuth-on-writing-up-research/), I'm going to start a **research journal**, where I communicate theoretical and conceptual ideas that I am exploring. 

I appreciate feedback! Just click on the title of a journal entry to leave a comment.
