Today, I spent some understanding the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. It was the 8th or 9th time I had tried to understand it, because even though there are many nice tutorials about it online, about three quarters of the way through reading a tutorial, my eyes start to glaze over the math, and I end up leaving with only a "high-level understanding" of it. Today, I think I truly get it, and I'm going to try to explain it in a way that would have been clearest to me from the beginning, with a minimal amount of mathematical notation:

**Motivating problem**: suppose you have two friends, Ali and Bilal, each of whom pick a random real number (\\(A\\) and \\(B\\)) between 0 and 1, and write their number on many slips of paper. Except they don't write their number exactly, but write it down a "noisy" version of it (meaning they add or subtract a value, picked from normal distribution, before writing it down). After Ali and Bilal write down their numbers, they stuff the slips into an envelope and hand it to you. Based only on the numbers written on the slips of paper, can you figure out \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)?

**Example:** 0.05, 0.07, 0.48, 0.06, 0.08, 0.53, 0.07, 0.03, 0.12, 0.45, 0.11, 0.47, 0.06

**Intuition**: If there was only one person, say Ali, writing down numbers, then this would be a very simple question. The best strategy is to simply average the numbers that you see in the envelope. A little bit of math, and just intuition, will tell you that this will give you a good estimate of \\(A\\). In fact, this estimate is _consistent_, meaning that with enough slips of paper, you can estimate \\(A\\) to any desired degree of accuracy. 

The tricky thing in this problem is that you have two real numbers \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), and each number that you see could
