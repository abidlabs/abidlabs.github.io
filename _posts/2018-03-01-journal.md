Today, I spent some understanding the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. It was the 8th or 9th time I had tried to understand it, because even though there are many nice tutorials about it online, about three quarters of the way through reading a tutorial, my eyes start to glaze over the math, and I end up leaving with only a "high-level understanding" of it (meaning I don't _really_ get it). Today, I think I truly understand it, and I'm going to try to explain it in a way that would have been clearest to me from the beginning, with a minimal amount of mathematical notation:

**Motivating problem**: suppose you have two friends, Ali and Bilal, each of whom pick a random real number ($A$ and $B$) between 0 and 100, and write their number on many slips of paper. Except they don't write their number exactly, but write it down a "noisy" version of it (meaning they add or subtract a value, picked from standard normal distribution, before writing it down). After Ali and Bilal write down their numbers, they stuff the slips into an envelope and hand it to you. Based only on the numbers written on the slips of paper, can you figure out the numbers Ali and Bilal chose?

**Intuition**: If there was only one person, say Ali, writing down numbers, then this would be a very simple question.
