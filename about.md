I am a 1st year PhD student at Stanford studying machine learning.

### My Story

I was born in 1993 in Karachi, Pakistan, but moved to the United States when I was 1 year old. I lived in the Midwest for several years, then moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, and then to Atlanta, Georgia, where I went to Walton High School. I went to MIT for my undergrad, where I majored in electrical engineering and computer science (6-2, B.S. ’15). During my undergraduate years, I did research with Professor Joel Voldman on neural probes, and with Professors Thomas Heldt and George Verghese, where I developed a new way to assess lung function using capnography. After that, I worked on my master’s degree, with Professor Robert Langer and Dr. Giovanni Traverso to build wireless communication and powering systems for ingestible electronics.
