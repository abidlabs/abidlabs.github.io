These are some of the projects that I have had a hand in developing.


## [Tarjimly](http://tarjim.ly)
Tarjimly is an early-stage non-profit organization that is helping to connect refugees and aid workers in real-time with crowdsourced translators. We were fortunate to be part of YCombinator's Winter 2018 batch, and now working to expand our translation services to millions of refugees who need critical translation help.

## Masjidtime
Masjidtime was a nationwide initiative that began at Harvard, MIT, and UCLA to create sustainable digital funding to non-profit organizations (primarily mosques) across United States.  The initiative helped organizations manage their financial sustainability, connect with the community, and increase donations. At its peak, Masjidtime worked with over 20 organizations.
